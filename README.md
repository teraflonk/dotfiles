# teraflonk's dotfiles and various configs

These are the configs from my "testing" machine, so what you see here is not the final product of my setup. If you wish to use these for whatever reason, then you'll require the following in order for it to work without tweaking:

1. Arch / Antergos / Manjaro (I use Manjaro)
2. i3-gaps window manager
3. Polybar
4. Compton compositor
5. URXVT
6. Bash
7. Feh
8. Wal
9. Neofetch
9. dmenu
10. Termsyn and FontAwesome

Of course, you can take snippets from the configs and it'll work fine without all those things. This list is mostly just to refresh my memory. Some of the things listed above have their own config files that aren't included in this repo. This is because I haven't modified the vanilla ones.

On my machine, FontAwesome is installed under /home/"username"/.fonts/ and Termsyn is installed wherever it tells you to in the readme (I can't remember).
